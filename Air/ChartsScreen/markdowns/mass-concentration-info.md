# SPS30 Mass Concentration and Health Impact

The **Sensirion SPS30** measures **mass concentration** of particulate matter (PM) in air, expressed in **micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³)**.  
This value represents the **total mass of airborne particles** within specific size ranges suspended in one cubic meter of air.

## What Is Mass Concentration?

Mass concentration describes how much *mass* of particles (in µg) is present in one cubic meter (m³) of air.

For example, a reading of **25 µg/m³ PM2.5** means that in one cubic meter of air, there are 25 micrograms of particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter.

Unlike number concentration (which counts particles), mass concentration focuses on **total particle mass**, which correlates more directly with **health effects** and is used by air quality standards worldwide.

## Particle Size Categories Measured by SPS30

### PM1.0 (0.3–1.0 µm)
**Typical sources:** Combustion residues, vehicle exhaust, tobacco smoke.  
**Health effects:** Reaches deep into the lungs (alveoli). Long-term exposure linked to inflammation, cardiovascular stress, and respiratory diseases.

---

### PM2.5 (0.3–2.5 µm)
**Typical sources:** Vehicle emissions, industrial combustion, wood burning, secondary aerosols.  
**Health effects:** Causes or worsens asthma, bronchitis, and heart disease. Chronic exposure increases the risk of premature death from respiratory and cardiovascular conditions.

---

### PM4.0 (0.3–4.0 µm)
**Typical sources:** Industrial dust and partially resuspended soil.  
**Health effects:** Irritates the airways, may cause coughing, and reduces lung function when levels are high over time.

---

### PM10 (0.3–10.0 µm)
**Typical sources:** Road dust, pollen, mold spores, coarse industrial particles.  
**Health effects:** Mostly affects the upper respiratory tract, causing throat irritation, coughing, and eye discomfort.

## WHO Mass Concentration Guidelines (2021)

These are internationally recognized exposure limits for long-term and short-term health protection.

| Parameter | Annual Mean Limit | 24-hour Mean Limit | Health Interpretation |
|------------|------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| **PM2.5** | 5 µg/m³ | 15 µg/m³ | Fine particles – should remain low to avoid chronic lung and heart damage |
| **PM10** | 15 µg/m³ | 45 µg/m³ | Coarser dust – irritates upper airways and eyes when levels rise |

*Values above these limits indicate increased risk for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.*

## Understanding the Readings

| Air Quality | PM2.5 (µg/m³) | PM10 (µg/m³) | Description |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Excellent** | 0–5 | 0–15 | Clean outdoor or mountain air |
| **Good** | 6–15 | 16–30 | Acceptable air, low health risk |
| **Moderate** | 16–35 | 31–60 | Sensitive people may feel irritation |
| **Unhealthy** | 36–55 | 61–90 | May cause symptoms in general population |
| **Hazardous** | >55 | >90 | Serious health effects with prolonged exposure |

## Summary

- **Mass concentration (µg/m³)** measures the *total weight* of airborne particles, which directly affects air quality and health.
- **PM2.5** and **PM10** are key metrics used by WHO and local environmental agencies.
- Smaller particles penetrate deeper into the respiratory system and cause greater harm.
- The **SPS30** provides calibrated mass concentration readings every second for precise and reliable air-quality monitoring.
